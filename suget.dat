00,Distant future. The humanity inhabits the Earth along with other planets of   the solar system. As a result more and more energy resources are needed which   will  prolong  the  existing of this enormous organism named  Lodestar,1,  the human space empire.,2
3,You're a space ranger charged with a special mission to transport the prime  source of energy. The Energy Sphere was created on the Earth with the joint     scientific effort to provide the whole Empire with energy. The very thought of  its hypothetic loss makes every Lodestar inhabitant feel the horror. To make the Sphere accumulate the energy it has to be on constant motion.,2,
  3,Unfortunately the Andropes from the neighboring galaxy are on the way of      Energy Sphere possession. Lodestar is forced to protect its prime source of    energy and the whole humanity.,01,

10,Your task is to resist the enemy attacks till Galactix arrive - the mightiest space vessel of the empire which will take away the Energy Sphere. Beware  the   space junk and alien spaceships which can damage the Sphere. Good luck!,11,

20,Ok... You've accomplished the mission. Galactix is due to arrive to get the   Sphere away but first you must destroy Andropes pursue it. Retain aliens to let the Sphere be delivered to the space station. Be careful!,21,

30,You've successfully resolved your task eliminating the enemy ships. But now   you're short of time as Galactix has just been heavily damaged! You have to     hurry up and  rescue the rest of  spaceship crew  escaping in  save  capsules.Go ahead!,31,

40,Excellent! The mission is accomplished! People are rescued but  their capsules are damaged and need fueling. The space refueler DL-1037F  is  floating nearby,1,  your task is to land capsules onboard of it for their fueling and repairing.    Speed up,1, you have little time!,41,

50,The worst has happened! Andropes  have invaded  all the  planets  of  Lodestar except Earth! Humanity  is on  the edge of extinction  as the alien fleet has  approached people's last citadel. Only a miracle can stop the enemy, this will be the last battle... But for whom?..,2,

3,You'll have to defend the Earth from enemy attacks! Everything now depends on you!,51,
